.SH NOTES
.PP
The primary issue is a security concern.
Anyone that needs to chat in the \[lq]room\[rq] has to be able to write
to the control file.
Anyone that needs read from the room needs read access.
Anyone that has access to these \[lq]control\[rq] files can also inject
anything they want into the chat.
This truly is built on the honor system, and was designed around a
single purpose: multi\-user chat between trusted users on a single host.
.PP
Don't expect this to be secure.

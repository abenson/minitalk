.SH NOTES
.PP
The primary issue is a security concern.
Anyone that needs to chat in the "room" has to be able to write to the
control file.
Anyone that needs read from the room needs read access.
Anyone that has access to these "control" files can also inject anything
they want into the chat.
This truly is built on the honor system, and was designed around a
single purpose: multi\-user chat between trusted users on a single host.
.PP
Don\[aq]t expect this to be secure.

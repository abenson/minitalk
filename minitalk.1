.SH NAME

minitalk - small, simple chat system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
minitalk FILE [NICK]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
FILE
File to use as \[lq]room\[rq].
Must have read/write permissions.
.TP
NICK
Specify nick to use.

Must be 1-15 characters in length, and must only contain numbers and
letters.

Join a room controlled via /var/chat/general.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ minitalk /var/chat/general
\f[R]

\f[R]
.fi
.SH NOTES
.PP
The primary issue is a security concern.
Anyone that needs to chat in the \[lq]room\[rq] has to be able to write
to the control file.
Anyone that needs read from the room needs read access.
Anyone that has access to these \[lq]control\[rq] files can also inject
anything they want into the chat.
This truly is built on the honor system, and was designed around a
single purpose: multi-user chat between trusted users on a single host.
.PP
Don\[cq]t expect this to be secure.
